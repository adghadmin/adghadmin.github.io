### Experience
#### Research Assistant | Computer Architecture and Embedded System Research Center, Shandong University | Feb. 2020 - Present
Supervised by [Dr. Zhaoyan Shen](https://szyatsdu.github.io/shenzhaoyan.git.io/zhaoyan_shen.html)  
**Project 1**: Design of Blockchain System Based on Cryptographic Algorithms and FPGA Implementation. We design the Ethereum system focusing on the replacement of some cryptographic algorithms used in the Ethereum. Specifically, we successfully replaced the hash algorithm Keccak-256 with SM3, the symmetric encryption algorithm AES with SM4, and the signature algorithm ECDSA with SM2. The modules of these algorithms are deployed on FPGA and ARM devices using Verilog and HLS technology. See [FPGA-Implementation-of-SM3](https://github.com/adghadmin/FPGA-Implementation-of-SM3.git) for the implementation of SM3.  
**Project 2**: A Framework for ReRAM-Based DNN Accelerator. We design an efficient pruning-quantization joint exploration framework for practical ReRAM-based DNN accelerator, which consists of a patch-wise pruning-quantization algorithm and a configurable mixed OU-based single bit ReRAM DNN engine. The algorithm significantly compresses DNN models based on comprehensive patch importance analysis. [Our paper](https://github.com/adghadmin/PQ-PIM-MSC-2021/blob/3e9fdae28a1c00436776a67334166b07ffb2bd9d/An%20Efficient%20Pruning-Quantization%20Joint%20Exploration%20Framework%20for%20Practical%20ReRAM-Based%20DNN%20Accelerator.pdf) has been accepted by [MSC@ESWEEK 2021](https://msc-esweek.github.io/program.html).  
**Project 3**: A Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Cache Cleaning Scheme for SMR. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) method to guide the PC cleaning of DM-SMR to hide its long tail latency from normal requests. A real-time Q-learning model is designed to decide the PC cleaning time and granularity. A fine-grained PC cleaning is proposed to maximize the utilization of idle I/O windows. A multiagent RL scheme with clustering is adopted to further mitigate the tail latencies and adapt to variable access patterns. [Our paper](https://github.com/adghadmin/MARL-PC-Cleaning/blob/155213bca881d2d6654530ef24b82cea7b647b80/A%20Multi-Agent%20Reinforcement%20Learning-Assisted%20Cache%20Cleaning%20Scheme%20for%20DM-SMR.pdf) has been submitted to [IEEE Transactions on Computers](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc). My mentor [Dr. Zhaoyan Shen](https://szyatsdu.github.io/shenzhaoyan.git.io/zhaoyan_shen.html) and I are co-first authors.  

#### Research Intern | FLPlab, École Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada | Jul. 2021 – Oct.2021  
Supervised by [Dr. François Leduc-Primeau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/leduc-primeau-francois)  
**[Mitacs Project](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship)** (Virtual): Ultra-low-energy IoT devices through more efficient error-correction codes and decoder circuits. In this research project, we develop methods for building error-correction codes and associated decoder systems that are more energy-efficient. I'm mainly in charge of developing a random number generator on FPGA for test and verification. I gave a [short survey report](https://github.com/adghadmin/General-Random-Number-Generator/blob/e9a66fadfe69239742ed6b3813bed8ac6dafb03c/A%20Short%20Survey%20on%20Uniform%20Random%20Number%20Generator%20and%20Gaussian%20Ramdom%20Number%20Generator%20with%20Implementation%20on%20FPGA.pdf) during the initial process of my project, and then designed [a random number generator on FPGA](https://github.com/adghadmin/General-Random-Number-Generator.git) using Verilog. My work has been highly recognized by Prof. François Leduc-Primeau, and I was awarded a [certificate of completion](https://github.com/adghadmin/General-Random-Number-Generator/blob/e33f592f7d792b1c155bed1feb12aa366baf1e2a/Certificate%20of%20Completion%20-%20Yang.pdf) of Mitacs project.
