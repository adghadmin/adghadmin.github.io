Project 1: Design of Blockchain System Based on Cryptographic Algorithms and FPGA Implementation. We design the Ethereum system focusing on the replacement of some cryptographic algorithms used in the Ethereum. Specifically, we successfully replaced the hash algorithm Keccak-256 with SM3, the symmetric encryption algorithm AES with SM4, and the signature algorithm ECDSA with SM2. The modules of these algorithms are deployed on FPGA and ARM devices using Verilog and HLS technology. See [FPGA-Implementation-of-SM3](https://github.com/adghadmin/FPGA-Implementation-of-SM3.git) for the implementation of SM3.  
Project 2: A Framework for ReRAM-Based DNN Accelerator. We design an efficient pruning-quantization joint exploration framework for practical ReRAM-based DNN accelerator, which consists of a patch-wise pruning-quantization algorithm and a configurable mixed OU-based single bit ReRAM DNN engine. The algorithm significantly compresses DNN models based on comprehensive patch importance analysis. Our paper has been accepted by [MSC@ESWEEK 2021](https://msc-esweek.github.io/program.html).  
Project 3: A Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Cache Cleaning Scheme for SMR, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computers, as the co-first author.
